Plumage
=======

Plumage generates colorful pictures.

![example output](ifdef({RUST}, {REPO/raw/master/})misc/example.png)

Installation
------------

Install with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install plumage
```

ifdef({RUST},, {dnl
Or, clone with Git and compile manually:

```bash
git clone REPO
cd plumage
cargo build --release  # Creates ./target/release/plumage
# Optionally, to install to ~/.cargo/bin:
cargo install --path .
```

})dnl
Usage
-----

See `plumage --help`. Plumage (optionally) reads parameters from `./params`
(see [params.example]) and generates a bitmap image, saving both the image and
the parameters used to generate it. These parameters can later be used as input
parameters to generate the same image, or they can serve as a starting point
and be tweaked. If any parameters are missing, they will be filled in with
either defaults or random values.

[params.example]: ifdef({RUST}, {REPO/blob/master/})params.example

ifdef({RUST},, {dnl
[generate.sh] generates images with Plumage in parallel and converts them to
PNG; see `./generate.sh --help`.

[generate.sh]: generate.sh

})dnl
For now, Plumage is best suited for technical users who wish to look through
the ifdef({RUST},
   {[source code]},
   {source code}) or learn by experimentation to discover what the different
parameters do and how the algorithm behaves.
